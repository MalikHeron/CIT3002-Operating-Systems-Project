# CIT3002-Operating-Systems-Project

A projecet to simulate a small process management system which will use a 
priority non-preemptive scheduling scheme when executing processes on a dual-core (2 CPU’s) 
processor system. The system manages twenty (20) processes and maintains a shared reusable 
resource list (list of integer pairs) that all processes will interact with; all processes perform some 
task on this shared resource. This prototype is aimed at demonstrating the concept of process 
synchronization by restricting access to the shared resource based on when processes are 
executing in its critical section.
